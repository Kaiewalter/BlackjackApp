# BlackjackApp
Implementation of blackjack app in Android Studio

Blackjack app will contain the following three views:
1) Main menu where the user can input an email address and then direct themselves to the other two views
2) Financial menu where the user can choose to withdraw or deposit money, resulting in an email being sent to the user's email account with a receipt of the transaction
3) Game screen where the actually blackjack game will be displayed
